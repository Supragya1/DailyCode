// Minimum number of jumps
// Q Given an array of N integers arr[] where each element represents the maximum length of the jump that can be made forward from that element. 
// This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y ≤ x.
// Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
